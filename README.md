Requirements:

Python 3.9 or later
Libraries (listed in requirements.txt)
Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
Running the Project:

Install dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
(Optional) Build Docker image:

Bash

docker build -t telegram-group-dashboard .
This creates a Docker image named "telegram-group-dashboard".

Run the application:

Without Docker:

Bash

flask run
This starts the Flask development server, accessible by default at [invalid URL removed]

With Docker:

Bash

docker run -p 5000:5000 telegram-group-dashboard
This runs the containerized application and maps the container port (5000) to the host port (5000).

Description:

The app.py file serves as the core Flask application, handling routes and rendering the dashboard interface. Data analysis and visualization logic are implemented in code_file.py (or your chosen filename). The config.py file stores configuration details (if needed).

Functionality:

Access key group metrics like member growth, active member ratio, message activity distribution.
View visualizations of these metrics for better understanding of trends.
(Future enhancements) Integrate with Telegram API to retrieve real-time data.
(Future enhancements) Implement functionalities for managing groups (e.g., member management, announcements).
Docx File:

A separate Docx file (not included here) details the 30 analytics and visualizations envisioned for the dashboard.
